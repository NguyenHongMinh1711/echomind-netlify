# EchoMind Netlify Deployment - Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the Netlify deployment issues for the EchoMind application.

## Issues Identified

1. **Invalid API Key Error**:
   - The application was showing an "Invalid API key" error on the signup page
   - This was likely due to incorrect API key configuration or environment variables

2. **Environment Variable Configuration**:
   - The `.env.production` file was using variable substitution that might not be properly resolved
   - The `env-config.js` file had mismatched API keys and was set to "development" mode

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues**:
   - The CSP was too restrictive, potentially blocking necessary resources or API calls
   - Some required domains might not have been included in the connect-src directive

4. **Authentication Flow Problems**:
   - The signup page was showing errors, suggesting issues with Supabase authentication integration

5. **Resource Loading Issues**:
   - Some resources and images were not loading properly

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `env-config.js`**:
   - Changed `VITE_APP_ENV` from "development" to "production"
   - Updated Supabase Anon Key to match the provided key
   - Ensured consistency between `window.ENV` and `window.ENV_CONFIG` objects

2. **Modified Content Security Policy in `netlify.toml`**:
   - Added 'unsafe-eval' to script-src to allow dynamic code evaluation
   - Expanded img-src to include all HTTPS sources
   - Added Hugging Face API to connect-src
   - Changed CSP mode from "strict" to "moderate" for better compatibility

3. **Updated Environment Variables in `netlify.toml`**:
   - Added Supabase URL and Anon Key to production environment
   - Added Mistral AI API key to production environment
   - Changed CSP mode to "moderate" for better compatibility

4. **Updated `.env.production`**:
   - Replaced variable substitution with hardcoded values
   - Added Mistral AI API key
   - Ensured all API keys are correctly formatted

## Expected Outcomes

These changes should resolve the following issues:

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - The "Invalid API key" error should be resolved
   - User registration and login should work correctly

2. **Resource Loading**:
   - All resources and images should load properly
   - The Resources page should display all content correctly

3. **API Connections**:
   - The application should be able to connect to Supabase and Mistral AI
   - Chat functionality should work correctly

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - The application should use the production environment
   - All environment variables should be correctly set

## Next Steps

After deploying the fixed version, it's recommended to:

1. Verify that all functionality works correctly
2. Test the authentication flow
3. Test the chat functionality
4. Test the journal functionality
5. Test the resources functionality
6. Check for any remaining console errors

If any issues persist, further investigation may be needed, particularly around:

1. API key validity and permissions
2. Supabase configuration
3. Content Security Policy adjustments
4. Network request handling
