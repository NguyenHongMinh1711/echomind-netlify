# EchoMind Netlify Deployment - Fixed Version

This document provides instructions for deploying the fixed version of the EchoMind application to Netlify.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Updated hardcoded environment variables in `env-config.js`
   - Set correct Supabase URL and Anon Key
   - Added Mistral AI API key
   - Changed environment from "development" to "production"

2. **Content Security Policy**:
   - Added 'unsafe-eval' to script-src to allow dynamic code evaluation
   - Expanded img-src to include all HTTPS sources
   - Added Hugging Face API to connect-src
   - Changed CSP mode from "strict" to "moderate" for better compatibility

3. **Configuration Files**:
   - Updated `.env.production` with hardcoded values instead of variable substitution
   - Added Mistral AI API key to environment variables
   - Ensured all API keys are correctly formatted

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify Dashboard

1. Log in to your Netlify account
2. Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to your GitHub repository containing the fixed EchoMind-netlify-ready code
4. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: Leave empty (we're using pre-built files)
   - Publish directory: `dist`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 2: Deploy via Netlify CLI

1. Install Netlify CLI if you haven't already:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Log in to your Netlify account:
   ```
   netlify login
   ```

3. Navigate to the EchoMind-netlify-ready directory:
   ```
   cd EchoMind-netlify-ready
   ```

4. Initialize a new Netlify site:
   ```
   netlify init
   ```

5. Deploy the site:
   ```
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying, verify the following:

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Test user registration
   - Test user login
   - Verify that the "Invalid API key" error is resolved

2. **Resource Loading**:
   - Check that all resources load correctly
   - Verify that images for resources appear properly

3. **API Connections**:
   - Test the chat functionality to ensure Mistral AI API is working
   - Verify that journal entries can be created and retrieved

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Check the browser console for any environment-related errors
   - Verify that the application is using the production environment

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after deployment:

1. **Check Netlify Logs**:
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to the site > Deploys > Deploy log
   - Look for any errors during the deployment process

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - In the Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set correctly

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open the deployed site in your browser
   - Open the developer tools (F12)
   - Check the console for any errors
   - Look for network requests that might be failing

4. **Content Security Policy Issues**:
   - If you see CSP-related errors in the console, you may need to further adjust the CSP in netlify.toml
   - Consider temporarily relaxing the CSP for debugging purposes

5. **API Key Issues**:
   - Verify that the Mistral AI API key is valid
   - Check that the Supabase Anon Key has the necessary permissions

## Additional Notes

- The fixed version uses hardcoded API keys in the environment files for simplicity
- For a production environment, consider using Netlify environment variables instead of hardcoding sensitive values
- The CSP has been relaxed to "moderate" to allow for better compatibility, but you may want to tighten it for production use
