# EchoMind Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Invalid API Key Error
- Added `VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY` to environment variables in both `env-config.js` and `netlify.toml`
- Added `DEFAULT_MISTRAL_API_KEY` to the `ENV_CONFIG` object in `env-config.js`
- Ensured consistent API key naming across all environment configurations

### 2. Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) Issues
- Enabled Row Level Security for tables that were missing it:
  - `prompt_responses`
  - `conversations`
  - `resources`

- Created appropriate RLS policies for each table:
  - Users can only view, insert, update, and delete their own data
  - Resources are viewable by all authenticated users but can only be modified by administrators

### 3. Performance Improvements
- Updated all RLS policies to use the recommended pattern with subselects:
  - Changed `auth.uid()` to `(SELECT auth.uid())` to improve query performance
  - Applied this pattern to all tables with RLS policies

- Created missing indexes for foreign keys:
  - `journals_user_id_idx` on `public.journals (user_id)`
  - `prompt_responses_prompt_id_idx` on `public.prompt_responses (prompt_id)`
  - `prompt_responses_user_id_idx` on `public.prompt_responses (user_id)`

## Deployment Configuration
- Updated all environment configurations in `netlify.toml` to include Supabase and Mistral API keys
- Ensured consistent environment variables across all deployment contexts:
  - Production
  - Deploy Preview
  - Branch Deploy

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated code to Netlify
2. Test the signup and login functionality to ensure the API key error is resolved
3. Verify that the RLS policies are working correctly by testing data access with different user accounts
4. Monitor the application for any other issues that may arise

## Security Considerations
- The RLS policies now ensure that users can only access their own data
- Resources are accessible to all authenticated users but can only be modified by administrators
- API keys are properly configured in the environment variables
